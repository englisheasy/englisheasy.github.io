乔布斯已经正确过两次，第一次我们有了苹果公司，第二次我们有了neXT公司。Macintosh主宰着，NeXT陷入困境。还有，乔布斯都正确，尽管 NeXT 未能出售其优雅且臭名昭著的黑匣子，乔布斯重要的远见---个人计算机用于相互连接，依靠网络生存，和他早期的预言一样精确，预言计算机作为个人装置。

现在乔布斯正在进行第三个关于未来的猜测，那些天他的激情是客观的，就是软件模块能组合成一个新应用(见"准备web对象")，好像一片片积木建造成玩具房子，乔布斯争论那，对象是保持互联网指数级增长的关键，他说，电子商务将加速下一阶段的网络爆发。

去年一个雾蒙的早上，我开车去电脑公司总部。在加州的雷德伍德城去见乔布斯。这建筑安静而整洁，伴随着低调奢华的公司氛围，这是进入第二十年的成功硅谷公司的典型特征。具有讽刺意味的是NeXT没有成功。在花光了投资者的数亿美金之后，这家公司放弃了电脑的生产，专注于销售、Nextstep操作系统的开发和关于面向对象的扩展。

在NeXT,乔布斯没有兴趣谈论皮克斯的动画工作室，他制作了世界上第一部完全由电脑生成特性的电影，《玩具总动员》（参照《玩具总动员》《连线》杂志第146页）乔布斯在1986年买下了卢卡斯电影股份有限公司的一个电脑部门成立了皮克斯。皮克斯以6000万的价格即将发行股票，他准备在一天内成为亿万富翁，对乔布斯来说，皮克斯已经是木已成舟的事情了，玩具总动员还在杀青的时候，他就准备让他的IPO来谈话。

换做另一种类型的高管可能只会谈论皮克斯。但是即使有机会自鸣得意，乔布斯一直在谈论Web目标和他对NeXT的雄心。他盯着下一件大事，这很好。毕竟，人们变得更有趣当他们在某件事情上失败时，他们从苹果下台，在NeXT奋斗以及皮克斯取得胜利，乔布斯现在正在进入他的第二轮命运之轮，他学到了什么？

当我们开始访谈时，乔布斯易燥的，他告诉我，他不在乎变革社会的任何事情，他不相信技术的变化能解决我们面临的最重要问题，他说，web的未来是在大公司手上，这是挣钱的地方，这是NeXT公司正在投掷产品的地方。

我情不自禁地好奇，乔布斯的肉身如何与苹果过去变革以及NeXT公司的早期保持一致，当交谈深入，这连接逐渐清晰起来，乔布斯的易燥缓和起来，他让自己思索web的大众化影响和希望防御微软的威胁，乔布斯是困扰的，对于竞争对手提出为合作者不寻常的提议，它是保持web简单和避免越来越流行的客户端hotJava增强。

在过去，乔布斯是一个美国教育的传道者，为了让学校有计算机，努力地工作，苹果公司和教育工作者的合作关系对建立Macintosh的市场起了关键作用，然而NeXT最初设计的工具主要服务学生和老师，现在，乔布斯直接了当地总结 ，技术不能解决我们教育系统的问题，他的新方案确定是低技术。

新一代的乔布斯嘲笑Web支持者幼稚的理想主义相信新媒体将让每个人成为出版商，他说Web的核心将是商业，商业的核心将是美国公司服务消费者的定制产品。麦金塔电脑暗含的信息正如“1984”伟大的广告中表述的那样令人难忘，是人民的力量。乔布斯对Web目标的愿景有着不同的使命:给人们他们想要的。

《连线》杂志：麦金塔电脑奠定了10年的基调。你认为网络会成为今天的基调吗?乔布斯：台式电脑行业已经死。创新实际上已经停止，微软几乎没有什么创新。这就结束了。苹果失去了。台式电脑的行业已经进入了黑暗的时代，在接下来的10年里，它将处于黑暗时代，或者只剩下这十年。

像在微处理器出来之前，IBM驱动了大量计算机行业创新，最终因为微软自满和可能一些新事物出来而崩溃，但直到那发生，直到一些基础重要技术改变，它就结束。

当前出现的最兴奋的事情是面向对象和web技术，web令人兴奋的两个原因：一，它是无处不在的，到处都是web拨号音，无处不在的获取任何兴趣的事情；二我不认为微软将找到一种方式拥有它。将有更多创新出现，那将创造一个地方，这里没有主宰的黑暗云网络

你认为为什么网络发展得这么快?

到目前为止，网络发展比较快的一个主要原因之一是因为简单。很多人想要让网络变得更复杂。他们想对客户进行处理，他们想要做这个做那个。我希望这种事情不要发生太快。它很像旧的大型机计算环境，Web浏览器就像一个哑终端，而Web服务器就像完成所有处理的主机。这种简单的模式已经产生了深远的影响开始变得无处不在。

面向对象？

当我1979年去Xerox PARC时，我看见了一个非常基础的图形用户界面，它不是完整的，它不是相当正确，但在10分钟里，某一天世界上每一个计算机将像这样方式运行，那是十分显然的，你能争论它将需要一些年，你能争论谁是胜者和输者，但你争论世界上每一台计算机将最终不像这样方式工作，我不认为这样。面向对象是类似的，一旦你理解面向对象，所有软件将最终用面向对象方式实现，它是清晰的。再说一遍，你能争论它将需要许多年，在过渡期谁是胜者和输者，但你不能争论过渡的不可逆转性。
面向对象编程仅仅将是在五年内所有软件将被用到的，或其他时间，那是令人信服的，它是那么显然的，那将发生是非常好的

对象怎么影响Web？

想想现在全民都直接通过Web把商品和服务给到客户。每个想要通过Web推销商品和服务的公司，都打算编写大量的定制应用软件。你不仅能买到现成的东西。您必须将Web连接到您的订单管理系统，你收集系统。这将是一个难以置信的工作量.
需要编写的应用程序的数量呈指数增长,除非我们能找到一种方法在十分之一的时间内写出它们，否则我们就完蛋了。
对象的最终结果,这是软件的重新包装,我们可以用其他方式开发应用仅仅要10%-20%时间开发软件。

我们看见人们通过拥有操作系统如何赢得桌面战争，人们如何在web上胜利？
web有三部分，第一是客户端，第二是管道，第三是服务器。在客户端，有浏览器软件，从挣钱角度看，它看起来任何人在浏览器软件端都不会胜利，因为它将是免费的，然后有对应硬件，一些人可能想出一些十分兴趣的web终端，然后卖一些硬件。
在管道方面，ROBCs将胜利，在接下来几月，你将看到他们将提供每月25美元的服务，你得到捆绑的ISDN，你得到挂到PC上的小盒子，你得到一个将非常流行的网络账号，ROBCs将是让你在web上的公司，通过做这些他们有既定的利息，他们想利用光纤公司，他们想保留客户，这是马上发生的事情，你不能看到它，它像树根一样在地下，它将长大，一些年内你将看到这颗大树。
关于服务器市场，像sun公司这样的公司正在做一个卖服务器的非常好的商业，但关于web服务软件，没有一家公司有超过单位数的市场份额，netscape公司艰难地卖任何服务，因为你能得到免费的公共域名软件，它是非常好的，一些人说它比买的服务更好，为了帮助人们建web应用，我们公司将在简单的web服务上面存放元素，web应用马上将是瓶颈的地方，创建主要贡献然后挣钱是真正的一些机会，那是所有关于web的事情。

这里还有其他机会吗？

你认为谁将是Web主要受益者？谁赢得最多？
人们谁有些东西-出售！分享，出售！
你的意思是出版?这不仅仅出版。这是商业。人们打算停止去很多商店。他们打算在Web上买东西。
Web作为最大的民主化怎么样？
如果你看看我这辈子做过的事情，他们有民主化的元素。Web是一个不可置信的民主化。一个小公司可以看起来像大公司一样，就像大公司一样容易在Web上访问。大公司花费数亿美元建立分销渠道，Web将完全消除这种优势。

下一周期民主进程结束后，经济景象会怎样？

web不将改变世界，确定不在下一个十年，它将增加世界广度，一旦你在web增量空间里面，你将看到民主出现。web不将捕捉到每人，如果web将占有这个国家商品和服务市场份额的百分之10以上，它将是惊人的，我认为将超过更多，甚至，它将成为国家经济的很大一部分。

## 重新思考革命

这技术将带来最大惊讶是什么？

问题是，我老了，我40岁了，这事情不能改变世界，它真的不会。

这将伤透人们的心。

很抱歉，这是真的。有了孩子真的会改变你对这些事情的观点，我们出生，我们活在短暂的瞬间，然后我们死去。它已经发生了很长时间了。如果有的话，技术没有改变太多。

这些技术可以让生活更容易，可以让我们接触到我们不可能接触到的人。你可能有一个先天性缺陷的孩子并能够接触到其他家长和支持团，获得药物信息，最新的实验药物。这些事情可以对我们的生活产生深远的影响。我没有轻视这点。但是这是一种伤害不断的用这种激进的新视角看待事物，它将改变任何事情。重要的事情不一定要改变世界。Web将会非常重要，这将是改变几百万人生活的事情吗？不，我的意思是可能吧。但是这时候不能确定是对的。它可能慢慢的传染给人们。这个肯定不会像人们第一次看到电视那样。他肯定不会像内布拉斯加州人第一次听到广播那样深远。它将不会那么深远。

然后web怎样影响我们的社会？

我们生活在信息经济中，但我不相信生活在信息社会中，人们现在比他们经常做的事情思考更少，主要原因是电视，人们阅读更少，确定他们现在思考更少，所以，我没发现大部分用web的人们得到更多信息，我们已经在信息泛滥中，与web分发出来多少信息无关，总之大部分人能看到远远更多信息，他们消化吸收少。
问题是在电视上？

当你年轻时，你看电视然后思考，这里有一个阴谋，网络协作浇灭我们，但是当你长大一点时，你意识到那不是真实的，网络是一个商业，它为了精确地给人们想要的事情，那是一个十分消极的思考，这个阴谋说的还乐观，你能骂这个混蛋，我们能有一个革命，但是真正地，网络是一个商业，为了给人们想要的事情，那是真的。

所以史蒂夫·乔布斯告诉我们，情况会继续恶化。

情况越来越糟了!每个人都知道他们在变坏!你不觉得情况越来越糟了吗?

我知道，但我希望我能来这里，看看他们怎样才能好起来。你真的相信世界正在变得更糟吗?或者你有一种感觉，你所参与的事情正在让世界变得更好?

不。世界越来越糟糕。在过去的15年里，情况变得更糟了。肯定。有两个原因。在全球范围内，人口急剧增长，而我们所有的结构，从生态到经济到政治，都无法应对。在这个国家，我们的政府中聪明的人似乎越来越少，人们似乎不太关注我们必须做出的重要决定。

但你好像对这个改变的潜力非常乐观

在这样情景我是一个乐观者，我相信人类是高尚的和受尊敬的，其中一些人是真正的聪明，我有一个非常乐观的个人看法，作为个人，人们本身是好的，我对集体中的人有某种程度上更悲观的看法，我们国家在许多方面在世界上是最幸运的地方，当我看见我们国家发生的事情，我一直十分关注，对于使我们国家为孩子有一个更好的地方，我们好像不兴奋的。

建造硅谷的人是工程师，他们学习商业，他们学习许多不同知识，但他们那些人有一个真正的信仰，如果他们和其他有创意且聪明的人一起努力工作，他们能解决大部分人类的问题，我十分相信这一点。
我相信带着基本的工程师视角的人们是在一个非常好的位置，能进来解决那些问题部分，但是在社会中，这行不通，那些人对政治事务没有吸引力，为什么一些人对政治事务会有吸引力

科技可以帮助改善教育吗？

我过去认为科技可以帮助教育。在这个星球上我牵头赠送给学校的电脑设备比任何人都多。但我不得不得出一个不可避免的结论，那就是这个问题不是技术能够解决的。教育的问题是不能用技术解决的。再多的技术也将无济于事。
这是一个政治问题。这些问题是社会政治问题。这个问题是工会。你绘制了国家教育协会的增长图，以及SAT分数的下降，它们是反比的。问题在于学校的工会。问题在于官僚主义。我是那种相信最好的事情的人，我们能做的就是使用完整的代金券系统。

我有一个17岁的女儿，她去高中之前在私人学校待了几年。这私人学校是我一生见过的学校中最好的一个，它是被评为美国最好100所学校之一，它是现象级的，这学费是5500美元一年，对于大部分父母来说那是一笔大钱，但老师比公立学校的老师工资低，所以对于老师层面那不是和钱有关，那年我问州财务主管：在加利福尼亚把小孩送到学校平均多少钱？我相信那是4400美元，然而没有许多父母能拿出5500美元一年，有许多父母拿出1000美元一年。
如果我们为父母拿出证明4400美元一年，学校将开始从右到左，人们将离开学院然后说：我们建立一个学校，你能有一个经历，在斯坦福学习<怎样成为学校商人>MBA课程，这个MBA将和其他人一起，他们开始建立学校，你已有那些年轻人，理想主义的人们建立学校，为钱而工作。

他们这样做是因为他们可以设置课程。当你有了孩子，你会想，我到底想让他们学什么？他们在学校学习的大部分东西都是完全无用的。但有些非常有价值的东西只有长大了才能学到，然而，你可以在年轻的时候学习它们。你会想，如果我为学校设置课程，我会怎么做?
天啊，那该有多令人兴奋啊!但你今天做不到。你要是现在还在学校工作，那你就是疯了。你不能做你想做的，你无权选择你的书，你的课程。你可以教一个狭窄的专业。谁会想这么做?

那是我们教育问题的解决方案，通过把所有知识放入CD-ROMs，你将不能解决问题，我们把网站放到每个学校，没有一个是坏的，仅当那哄我们认为我们正在做些事为了解决教育问题，这是坏的。
林肯在小木屋没有网站，他的父母在这里家庭学校式教养他，他结果相当有兴趣，历史祖先展示了那，在没有技术情况下我们最终令人类惊讶，祖先也展示了，我们带着技术是十分无趣的人类。
当你在20世纪，在技术改变世界的时代，那不是和你想的一样简单，在一些方式上它将改变世界，在另一些方式不会改变。

What's good for business is good for the Web
If you go back five years, the Web was hardly on anybody's horizon. Maybe even three years ago, it wasn't really being taken seriously by many people. Why is the sudden rise of the Web so surprising?

Isn't it great? That's exactly what's not happening in the desktop market.

Why was everyone, including NeXT, surprised, though?

It's a little like the telephone. When you have two telephones, it's not very interesting. And three is not very interesting. And four. And, well, a hundred telephones perhaps becomes slightly interesting. A thousand, a little more. It's probably not until you get to around ten thousand telephones that it really gets interesting.

Many people didn't foresee, couldn't imagine, what it would be like to have a million, or a few tens of thousands of Web sites. And when there were only a hundred, or two hundred, or when they were all university ones, it just wasn't very interesting. Eventually, it went beyond this critical mass and got very interesting very fast. You could see it. And people said, "Wow! This is incredible."

The Web reminds me of the early days of the PC industry. No one really knows anything. There are no experts. All the experts have been wrong. There's a tremendous open possibility to the whole thing. And it hasn't been confined, or defined, in too many ways. That's wonderful.

There's a phrase in Buddhism,"Beginner's mind." It's wonderful to have a beginner's mind.

Earlier, you seemed to say there's a natural affinity between the Web and objects. That these two things are going to come together and make something very new, right?

Let's try this another way. What might you want to do on a Web server? We can think of four things:

One is simple publishing. That's what 99 percent of the people do today. If that's all you want to do, you can get one of a hundred free Web-server software packages off the Net and just use it. No problem. It works fine. Security's not a giant issue because you're not doing credit card transactions over the Web.

The next thing you can do is complex publishing. People are starting to do complex publishing on the Web---very simple forms of it. This will absolutely explode in the next 12 to 18 months. It's the next big phase of the Web. Have you seen the Federal Express Web site where you can track a package? It took Federal Express about four months to write that program---and it's extremely simple. Four months. It would be nice to do that in four days, or two days, or one day.
The third thing is commerce, which is even harder than complex publishing because you have to tie the Web into your order-management system, your collection system, things like that. I think we're still two years away. But that's also going to be huge.

Last is internal Web sites. Rather than the Internet, it's intranet. Rather than write several different versions of an application for internal consumption---one for Mac, one for PC, one for Unix---people can write a single version and have a cross-platform product. Everybody uses the Web. We're going to see companies have dozens---if not hundreds---of Web servers internally as a means to communicate with themselves.

Three of those four functions of the Web require custom applications. And that's what we do really well with objects. Our new product, WebObjects, allows you to write Web applications 10 times faster.

How does the Web affect the economy?

We live in an information economy. The problem is that information's usually impossible to get, at least in the right place, at the right time.

The reason Federal Express won over its competitors was its package-tracking system. For the company to bring that package-tracking system onto the Web is phenomenal. I use it all the time to track my packages. It's incredibly great. Incredibly reassuring. And getting that information out of most companies is usually impossible.

But it's also incredibly difficult to give information. Take auto dealerships. So much money is spent on inventory---billions and billions of dollars. Inventory is not a good thing. Inventory ties up a ton of cash, it's open to vandalism, it becomes obsolete. It takes a tremendous amount of time to manage. And, usually, the car you want, in the color you want, isn't there anyway, so they've got to horse-trade around. Wouldn't it be nice to get rid of all that inventory? Just have one white car to drive and maybe a laserdisc so you can look at the other colors. Then you order your car and you get it in a week.

Today a dealer says, "We can't get your car in a week. It takes three months." And you say, "Now wait a minute, I want to order a pink Cadillac with purple leather seats. Why can't I get that in a week?" And he says, "We gotta make it." And you say, "Are you making Cadillacs today? Why can't you paint a pink one today?" And he says, "We didn't know you wanted a pink one." And you say, "OK. I'm going to tell you I want a pink one now." And he says, "We don't have any pink paint. Our paint supplier needs some lead time on that paint.' And you say, "Is your paint supplier making paint today?" And he says, "Yeah, but by the time we tell him, it takes two weeks." And you say, "What about leather seats?" And he says, "God, purple leather. It'll take three months to get that."

You follow this back, and you find that it's not how long it takes to make stuff; it's how long it takes the information to flow through the system. And yet electronics move at the speed of light---or very close to it.
So pushing information into the system is sometimes immensely frustrating, and the Web is going to be just as much of a breakthrough in terms of pushing information in as getting information out.

Your view about the Web is an alternative to the commonly held one that it's going to be the renaissance of personal publishing. The person who can't get published through the broadcast media will get a chance to say something.

There's nothing wrong with that. The Web is great because that person can't foist anything on you---you have to go get it. They can make themselves available, but if nobody wants to look at their site, that's fine. To be honest, most people who have something to say get published now.

But when we ask how a person's life is changed by these technologies, pushing information to customize products makes marginal differences. You go to the store and there's a lot of different kinds of toilet paper---some have tulips embossed on them and some don't. You're standing there making a choice, and you want the one with the embossed.

I like the ones without the tulips.

I do, too---and unscented. But that customization is relevant to you for that second but in no other way. For the average person, the possibility to participate as a publisher or a producer has a higher value for them.

I don't necessarily agree. The best way to think of the Web is as a direct-to-customer distribution channel, whether it's for information or commerce. It bypasses all middlemen. And, it turns out, there are a lot of middlepersons in this society. And they generally tend to slow things down, muck things up, and make things more expensive. The elimination of them is going to be profound.

Do you think large institutions are going to be the center of the economy, basically driving it as they are now? Some people say the big company is going to fragment.

I don't see that. There's nothing wrong with big companies. A lot of people think big business in America is a bad thing. I think it's a really good thing. Most people in business are ethical, hard-working, good people. And it's a meritocracy. There are very visible examples in business of where it breaks down but it's probably a lot less than in most other areas of society.

You don't think that structural economic changes will tend to shrink the size of these large companies?

Large companies not paying attention to change will get hurt. The Web will be one more area of significant change and those who don't pay attention will get hurt, while those who see it early enough will get rewarded.

The Web is just going to be one more of those major change factors that businesses face every decade. This decade, in the next 10 years, it's going to be the Web. It's going to be one of them.

But doesn't the Web foster more freedom for individuals?

It is a leveling of hierarchy. An individual can put up a Web site that, if they put enough work into it, looks just as impressive as the largest company in the world.
I love things that level hierarchy, that bring the individual up to the same level as an organization, or a small group up to the same level as a large group with much greater resources. And the Web and the Internet do that. It's a very profound thing, and a very good thing.

Yet the majority of your customers for WebObjects seem to be corporations.

That's correct. And big ones.

Does that cause you any kind of conflict?

Sure. And that's why we're going to be giving our WebObjects software away to individuals and educational institutions for noncommercial use. We've made the decision to give it away.

Shooting the Web in the foot
What do you think about HotJava and the like?

It's going to take a long time for that stuff to become a standard on the Web. And that may shoot the Web in the foot. If the Web becomes too complicated, too fraught with security concerns, then its proliferation may stop---or slow down. The most important thing for the Web is to stay ahead of Microsoft. Not to become more complicated.

That's very interesting. Java pushes the technology toward the client side. Do you find that wrong?

In my opinion? In the next two years? It's dead wrong. Because it may slow down getting to ubiquity. And anything that slows down the Web reaching ubiquity allows Microsoft to catch up. If Microsoft catches up, it's far worse than the fact the Web can't do word processing. Those things can be fixed later.

There's a window now that will close. If you don't cross the finish line in the next two years, Microsoft will own the Web. And that will be the end of it.

Let's assume for a second that many people share an interest in a standard Web that provides a strong alternative to Microsoft. However, when it comes to every individual Web company or Web publisher, they have an interest in making sure that their Web site stays on the edge. I know we do at HotWired. And so we have to get people into HotJava---we have to stay out there---which doesn't bode well for retaining simplicity. We're going to be part of that force pushing people toward a more complicated Web, because we have no choice.

The way you make it more complex is not by throwing stuff on the client side but by providing value, like Federal Express does, by becoming more complex on the server side.

I'm just very concerned that if the clients become smart, the first thing this will do is fracture the Web. There won't be just one standard. There'll be several; they're all going to fight; each one has its problems. So it's going to be very easy to say why just one shouldn't be the standard. And a fractured Web community will play right into Microsoft's hands.

The client-server relationship should be frozen for the next two years, and we shouldn't take it much further. We should just let it be.

By collective agreement?

Yeah. By collective agreement. Sure. Go for ubiquity. If Windows can become ubiquitous, so can the existing Web.

How did Windows become ubiquitous?

A force of self-interest throughout the industry made Windows ubiquitous. Compaq and all these different vendors made Windows ubiquitous. They didn't know how to spell software, but they wanted to put something on their machines. That made Windows ubiquitous.

So it just kind of happened.

No, it was sort of an algorithm that got set in motion when everyone's self-interest aligned toward making this happen. And I claim that the same sort of self-interest algorithm is present on the Web. Everyone has a self-interest in making this Web ubiquitous and not having anyone own it---especially not Microsoft.

Is the desktop metaphor going to continue to dominate how we relate to computers, or is there some other metaphor you like better?

To have a new metaphor, you really need new issues. The desktop metaphor was invented because one, you were a stand-alone device, and two, you had to manage your own storage. That's a very big thing in a desktop world. And that may go away. You may not have to manage your own storage. You may not store much before too long.

I don't store anything anymore, really. I use a lot of e-mail and the Web, and with both of those I don't have to ever manage storage. As a matter of fact, my favorite way of reminding myself to do something is to send myself e-mail. That's my storage.

The minute that I don't have to manage my own storage, and the minute I live primarily in a connected versus a stand-alone world, there are new options for metaphors.

GrokKing design
You have a reputation for making well-designed products. Why aren't more products made with the aesthetics of great design?

Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it's all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it. Most people don't take the time to do that.

Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they've had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.

Unfortunately, that's too rare a commodity. A lot of people in our industry haven't had very diverse experiences. So they don't have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one's understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.

Is there anything well designed today that inspires you?

Design is not limited to fancy new gadgets. Our family just bought a new washing machine and dryer. We didn't have a very good one so we spent a little time looking at them. It turns out that the Americans make washers and dryers all wrong. The Europeans make them much better---but they take twice as long to do clothes! It turns out that they wash them with about a quarter as much water and your clothes end up with a lot less detergent on them. Most important, they don't trash your clothes. They use a lot less soap, a lot less water, but they come out much cleaner, much softer, and they last a lot longer.

We spent some time in our family talking about what's the trade-off we want to make. We ended up talking a lot about design, but also about the values of our family. Did we care most about getting our wash done in an hour versus an hour and a half? Or did we care most about our clothes feeling really soft and lasting longer? Did we care about using a quarter of the water? We spent about two weeks talking about this every night at the dinner table. We'd get around to that old washer-dryer discussion. And the talk was about design.

We ended up opting for these Miele appliances, made in Germany. They're too expensive, but that's just because nobody buys them in this country. They are really wonderfully made and one of the few products we've bought over the last few years that we're all really happy about. These guys really thought the process through. They did such a great job designing these washers and dryers. I got more thrill out of them than I have out of any piece of high tech in years.
