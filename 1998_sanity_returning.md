没有人可以怀疑史蒂文.乔布斯的魅力。这位苹果公司临时的CEO，在1985年被不光彩的解雇后，于去年7月回到了公司，带回了他传奇般的远见、急躁和耐心，对麦金塔电脑的充满了热情。5月11日，苹果公司刚刚推出新的软件战略时，乔布斯在4楼会议室接受《商务周刊》记者安迪.莱茵哈特采访，

Q:现在你已经介绍了新的而且外观独特的iMac，难道你将做一些激进而不同的产品？

A:关于这件事情有许多需要谈论的地方--关于手提式机顶盒。许多计算机公司已正在探索消费者产品，从我的观点看，个人电脑已是过去十年最成功的消费者产品，我们必须做而且行业已停止做的事情是瞄准市场上的消费者PC部分，IBM想一直是IBM，戴尔正在卖给主要企业市场，康柏电脑公司刚刚收购了dec公司--我的天啊，想成为IBM的公司没有什么不对的。
但苹果的风格却完全不同。我曾经说过，苹果应该成为这个行业的索尼，但实际上，我认为苹果应该成为这个行业的苹果。通过这些新产品，苹果无疑正在向这一目标迈进。此外，因为皮克斯，我在娱乐行业有了一些经验。我要告诉你，当你想打开你的大脑时，你会去互联网，当你想关闭你的大脑时，你会去电视。我根本不相信这两个人会相遇。

Q:iMac的售价为1,299美元，即便能与低于1,000美元的个人电脑竞争，但仍不属于消费电子产品的范畴。

A:PC电脑不在合理价格范围，但人们在看性价比，我们的目标是像iMacs产品一样继续降低价格，它一部分是和你觉得那些设备有多大必要性有关。大部分人开始感觉到有一台个人计算机，特别是它能够像家里的iMac一样传送丰富的互联网体验，这是一个基本工具，iMac和新英格兰冬天供暖花销一样多，比汽车少，总之我们不在最佳点，但我们已到这里，对于苹果，这是相当大的一步，在过去一些年，在2000美元以下，苹果还没有一个竞争力的产品。

Q：你在开发iMac的时候做过消费者调查吗?

A：不是，我们有很多客户，我们做了很多的研究对我们的基础安装。我们也非常仔细地关注行业的趋势。但是最终，对于那么复杂的事情，它真的很难对焦点群体设计产品。很多时候，人们不知道他们想要什么，直到你展示给他们看。这就是为什么很多人在苹果公司可以拿到很高的薪水，因为他们应该在这些事情的顶端。

Q:你为什么决定反对内部的软盘而选择缓慢的调制解调器？

A:你知道，你问对了问题，仅使用软盘：人们没有清晰地思考过。没有人将备份4g的驱动到1m大小的软盘，他们将用zip驱动 - 但他们放入消费电子产品中是太昂贵的，而且，几乎没有任何人在任何情况下备份，所以，为什么要每个系统带来这些代价？关于软盘的第二个原因是软件分配，但许多软件现在出现在CD-ROMs中，因为它是更好且更便宜[iMac包含有CD-ROM驱动]

Q: How much of a role did you have in the design of the product?
A: A fair bit. [Smiles] There were several teams. On a day-to-day basis, my job wasn't to head any of them. We have really talented people to do that. But when I got here last July, it took me about two weeks to figure out that Apple didn't have a consumer product in the pipe. I began a crash program in August to create one. We put together various teams.

Q: But you smiled when I asked the question. Do you feel this is your baby?
A: We all feel like it's our baby. Everybody at Apple has a pride in it, because it represents what Apple ought to be doing. You expect this kind of innovation from Apple. Apple is getting back to that, and it's something we can all be proud of.

Q: What are you doing about increasing the number of Mac software programs?
A: Let's focus first on the real problem. Forget the perception. The real problem is that a lot of developers have had a really tough time dealing with Apple over the last few years. I talked to these folks. It wasn't even about the volume of Mac sales declining -- it was problems in dealing with Apple. We fixed almost all of that. The developers are coming back, and it feels really good. We haven't brought everybody back yet, but a lot of them.

Q: Are you going to take the CEO job permanently?
A: There's nothing new to report. I just decided one day that for me, it just wasn't such a big deal. I didn't have to lose sleep over this, worry about this. I'm Apple's interim CEO, and it won't be forever, and I'm doing the best that I can. But I'm the full-time CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, and I love it, and I also have a family. I'm doing the best I can here. If folks think there's a better solution, I'll be glad to step aside. And eventually we'll find somebody else to take the reins.

Q: What about stock ownership? Do you intend to take a stake in the company?
A: This isn't about money for me.

Q: I'm talking about the symbolic value.
A: That's not my problem. I've worked my tail off here. I don't think I could work any harder. I'm trying to help Apple. I do have more time now to be with my family. We've filled out our senior management team. We've got a good team now, and we're firing on all cylinders. And as the strategy becomes clearer to more of the people in the company, it really makes things much easier. The organization is clean and simple to understand, and very accountable. Everything just got simpler. That's been one of my mantras -- focus and simplicity. Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains.

Q: There's a lot of symbolism to your return. Is that going to be enough to reinvigorate the company with a sense of magic?
A: You're missing it. This is not a one-man show. What's reinvigorating this company is two things: One, there's a lot of really talented people in this company who listened to the world tell them they were losers for a couple of years, and some of them were on the verge of starting to believe it themselves. But they're not losers. What they didn't have was a good set of coaches, a good plan. A good senior management team. But they have that now.

So, the first thing to invigorating people is winning again. They're seeing us win, by the customer reactions to the products, by the sales, the profitability, all of those signs that people want what we've got again. And, that we can run our business well. That our own house is in order, that we've stopped the waste that people have seen with their own eyes without knowing what to do about it. There's sanity returning.

The second thing that's reinvigorating them is that Apple is starting to innovate again. There's been a vacuum in this industry for a long time, in many ways, and that vacuum is in a lot of areas where Apple's legacy is. So Apple is back to its roots, starting to innovate again, and people are sensing that, seeing it concretely, and really feeling good about it. That's why they came here. That's what they want to do. When they see the iMac, for example, they think we really can produce industry-leading products like this. It's not about charisma and personality, it's about results and products and those very bedrock things that are why people at Apple and outside of Apple are getting more excited about the company and what Apple stands for and what its potential is to contribute to the industry.

Q: What's the coolest stuff you have coming down the product pipe?
A: We have some pretty cool stuff coming, but we don't talk about it.

Q: Will they be computers?
A: Yes. We're not going off into la-la land.
